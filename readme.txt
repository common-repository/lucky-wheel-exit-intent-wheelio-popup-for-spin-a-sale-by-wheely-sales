== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which wheel parts can I customize for my website? =
The whole wheel popup is fully customizable so you can make it say, do and look exactly how you want! This includes the colors, logos, text and fields.

= Does Wheely Sales work on mobile? =
Of course! The popup is fully responsive, so it adjusts and looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.

= Will it affect my website speed and SEO? =
No - keeping your website speedy and ranking on google is a big priority. So Wheely Sales is designed to only load only after your website is fully loaded and not affect speed or SEO.

= When does the popup wheel show? =
Wheely Sales is designed to popup on exit intent. This means as soon as your visitor is about to leave your website. On desktop this is specifically when the mouse moves up and out of the browser window and for mobile this is when a user suddenly scrolls up.

= Will a visitor see the wheel popup every time they visit my website? =
No. They will see it the first time they visit, and then we won't load the wheel for that visitor for a specific number of days which you control. This way, you're in charge and visitors can't take advantage of the system.

= Is Wheely Sales GDPR compliant? =
Yes. Wheely Sales allows you to add a GDPR-compliant checkbox that visitors are required to accept to receive marketing emails.

= Can I translate the wheel into any language? =
Absolutely! All of text in the Wheely Sales popup is fully customizable. This means you can translate it into any language.
